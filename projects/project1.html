    <h1>Android/iOS mobile Application </h1>
    <body class="middleText">
        This is an application that I designed, built and distributed for a local company in Marquette County.
        The project was done as a volentary effort to help the Lake Superior Community Partnership jumpstart the 
        economy after the damaging impacts of COVID-19. It was seen as an easy way to get some real development 
        experience while also being able to help out my local community.
