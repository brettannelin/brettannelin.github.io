            This is an application that I designed, built and distributed for a local non-profit organization in Marquette County.
            The project was done as a volentary effort to help the Lake Superior Community Partnership jumpstart the 
            economy after the damaging impacts of COVID-19. It was seen as an easy way to get some real development 
            experience while also being able to help out my local community. <br><br><br>
